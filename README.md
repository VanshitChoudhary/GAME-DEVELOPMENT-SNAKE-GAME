SNAKE-DEVELOPMENT-GAME-
This project is a simple yet fun Snake Game built using C++ and the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) framework. It was created as part of a game development internship task with the goal of learning how to combine graphics, user input, and basic game logic in a visually engaging way. The gameplay is based on the classic Snake concept — the player controls a green snake that moves across the screen, consuming red food blocks that appear randomly on the grid. Each time the snake eats a food item, it grows longer and the score increases. As the score goes up, the speed of the snake also increases, making the game progressively more difficult and testing the player's reaction time. The game is displayed in a window with smooth 2D visuals and uses sound effects to enhance the experience. A sound plays each time the snake eats food, and another plays when the player loses (by colliding with the walls or the snake’s own body). The controls are simple and intuitive — players use the arrow keys on the keyboard to change the direction of the snake in real time. The game automatically restarts after a game over, allowing for continuous play. The code is written in a clean and modular way, making it easy to understand and extend. For example, it would be fairly simple to add a pause menu, a difficulty selector, or even levels with obstacles. The SFML library handles all the graphics rendering, window management, and audio playback, which makes it ideal for this kind of 2D game. To build and run the game, you just need a C++ compiler and SFML installed on your system. On Linux, the setup is straightforward using apt to install SFML, and on Windows, tools like Visual Studio or vcpkg can be used to configure the project. All asset files — such as the font (arial.ttf) and sounds (eat.wav, gameover.wav) — are stored locally in the project folder and must be placed next to the compiled executable to work properly. This project not only serves as a learning experience in game development but also demonstrates skills in real-time programming, user input handling, collision detection, and UI rendering. It’s a small but complete game that shows how fundamental programming concepts can be combined to build something interactive and enjoyable. The idea was to keep things simple and clean while also giving the game a polished feel. From the dynamic speed increase to the way the score is displayed, every part of the game was designed with both learning and fun in mind. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand how games work behind the scenes, or just someone who enjoys nostalgic arcade games, this project is a solid foundation for further development. Overall, building this game has been a rewarding experience and a valuable addition to my C++ and SFML skills.
